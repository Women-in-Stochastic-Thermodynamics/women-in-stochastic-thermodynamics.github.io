            <h1>Women* in Stochastic Thermodynamics</h1>

            <p>We are a group of women in Stochastic Thermodynamics and related research areas. Our goal is to create a
                platform for scientific exchange, networking, collaboration, and mentorship. Through this group, we also
                aim to increase the visibility of women in this field and to promote diversity and inclusion within the
                broader scientific community.
            </p>

            <p>We believe that regular meetings to connect with other female* researchers can be highly beneficial for
                career development and for attracting more people from underrepresented groups to our research
                community. To
                this end, we host informal meetings once per quarter, each including both a scientific part and a
                non-scientific part. In the latter, we discuss topics such as the experience of being part of an
                underrepresented group in academia, career development, and other relevant issues.
            </p>

            <p>
                Everyone—from students to early-career and senior researchers—is warmly invited to join. Please feel
                free to
                spread the word within your local networks!</p>

            <p>
                Moreover, if you are a researcher outside of the group, we invite you to share your job offers,
                invitations
                to scientific events, talks or other opportunities, through our mailing list.</p>

            <h2>Philosophy</h2>

            <p>*While we refer to “women” and “female” for the sake of simplicity, we explicitly and warmly welcome
                everyone who identifies as a woman, non-binary, or gender-diverse. Moreover, all our meetings and events
                are
                open to anyone interested in the topics we discuss, regardless of gender identity. Our goal is to foster
                inclusion, not exclusion.</p>
